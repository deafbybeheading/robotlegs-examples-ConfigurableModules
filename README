A simple (currently non-working) example of using RL, Signals,
Presentation Models, and a modular application. Note that the modules
are not modules in the Flex sense: they could be, but that's
orthogonal to this architecture. The important part is that each
module has its own local context, and each module's interactions can
either be confined to that context or shared with other modules (and
the parent application) through injected Signals. The other important
part is that, unlike the other modular RL examples I've seen (and like
Theo Hultberg's documentbased Mate example application), each module
is injected with a unique configuration when it is first created.
